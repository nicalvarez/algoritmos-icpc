# Algoritmos ICPC

This is a repository with useful algorithms for competitive programming.
Many of the ideas, and some of the codes are taken from somewhere else, I should look for the references and make the proper citations.
Some other stuff is implemented by friends of mine and by myself.

If you are interested in competitive programming, I recommend to check out:
- https://cp-algorithms.com/
- https://github.com/atcoder/ac-library


I am trying to clean things up so it can be more useful for the community. 
I hope you can find something useful in this lines of codes.

*TODO*:
* Find references and cite them
* Make more comments on how the algorithms work
* Deduplicate functionality
* Make cleaner code if possible

*PENDING IMPLEMENTATIONS*
* Hungarian algorithm
* Link-cut tree
* Geo: Line + Circle 

If you are interested in collaborating, just make a pull request.
Or just send a message.
